Description:
    RIP is a simple framework for building RESTful servers in OCaml.  It's basically a thin 
    wrapper on top of Cohttp that takes care of some of the boilerplate involved in writing
    a RESTful server.  It makes sure the proper response codes are sent when various error
    conditions occur, and automatically routes requests based on content-type and accept
    headers.  Another notable feature is the support for type-safe routing to resources.
